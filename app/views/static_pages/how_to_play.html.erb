  <h1>Overall Idea</h1>
  <p class="explanation-text">
    There are two teams, one attacking (red) and one defending (grey).
    The goal for the attacking team is to remove the king (the center piece with the gold ring) from the game.
    The goal for the defending team is to get the king to one of the corner tiles so he can escape.

  <h1>Piece Movement</h1>
  <p class="explanation-text">
    When thinking of moving pieces, think of rooks from standard chess. Pieces can only move horizontally or vertically,
    however the distance is unrestricted. No pieces can jump over other pieces.
  </p>
  <br/><br/>
  <h1>Turns</h1>
  <p class="explanation-text">
    This is a turn based game, so it needs to be your turn to move any of your pieces. Also, be aware that the attacking
    team moves first.
  </p>
  <br/><br/>
  <h1>Piece Capturing</h1>
  <p class="explanation-text">
    Capturing pieces is simple. Just move one of your pieces onto the tile that an enemy piece is on to capture it.
  </p>
  <br/><br/>
  <h1>Winning as the Attacking Team</h1>
  <p class="explanation-text">
    For the attacking team to win, the king needs to be captured. This is done by attacking the king twice. In the first
    attack, the attacking piece will be sacrificed. This will wound the king and turn his gold ring to dark blue, shown
    below.

  <br/><br/>
  <p class="explanation-text">
    The king will not be able to withstand another attack, and will be captured if he's attacked again in this state.
  </p>
  <br/><br/>
  <h1>Winning as the Defending Team</h1>
  <p class="explanation-text">
    To win as the defending team, the king must move to one of the red corner tiles without being captured, shown below.
